        <h2>How to Play Simon's Memory Quest</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Simon's Memory Quest! Can you keep up with the pattern and master your memory skills? Here's how
            it works:</p>

        <h3>Desktop Instructions:</h3>
        <p>Start the game by pressing any key on your keyboard.</p>

        <h3>Touch Device Instructions:</h3>
        <p>If you're using a touchscreen device, tap an empty space on the screen to begin.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You'll see four colorful boxes: red, yellow, green, and purple.</li>
            <li>One of these boxes will randomly blink.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Level 1:</h3>
        <p>Remember the color that blinked and click on that box.</p>

        <h3>Level 2:</h3>
        <p>After 1 second, another box will randomly blink. Click both the previously blinked box and the new one.</p>

        <h3>Level 3:</h3>
        <p>After completing the previous level, another box will blink. Now, remember and click on all three boxes
            correctly from the beginning.</p>

        <h3>And So On:</h3>
        <p>The game keeps adding more boxes and challenges as you progress.</p>

        <h3>Game Over:</h3>
        <p>If you click the wrong box or the wrong order, the game ends. Your score and the correct order will be
            displayed on the screen for you to review your mistakes.</p>

        <h3>Blink Color:</h3>
        <p>When a box blinks or flashes randomly, it will turn white for a few milliseconds.
            <br>
            When you successfully press the box, it will turn green for a few milliseconds.
        </p>
